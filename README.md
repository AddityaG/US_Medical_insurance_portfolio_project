This is a course portfolio starter project that was built in jupyter notebook document using visual studio code as the code editor. Every function in this project are developed to perform different calculations to showcase result of different ideas for analyzation of the US Medical Insurance Cost dataset.

•	Find the cost difference between smokers and non-smokers 

•	Analyze where a majority of the individuals are from. 

•	Figure out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child in this dataset.

The ratio between male and female (m:w) candidates in the dataset is 1.02

The insurance cost difference between smokers and non-smokers is 32050.23 VS 8434.27
